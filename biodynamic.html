        <!--Summary:-->
        <p> Morgan Creek Vineyard is an aspiring biodynamic vineyard. They are the first winery built in southern Minnesota and has been producing wine for the past 27 years. For the Capstone project I want to merge the concept of biodynamics with graphic design. This will be a branding expansion project where there will be icons, label series, informational signage &amp; etc. The goal is to express the methods of biodynamics within the graphics.</p>

        <p> You might be wondering, what is biodynamics? It is a ecological, holistic, &amp; earth conscious form of farming that was founded by the philosopher &amp; scientist Rudolf Steiner. Many of the methods used in biodynamics are created in consideration of how all elements work together. For example there are animals such as sheep on the farm to prune the weeds, fermented manure that enhances the root systems, and a lunar calendar that determines the different treatments for a variety of plants. There are absolutely no chemicals such herbicides and pesticides used. The difference between organics and biodynamics is that biodynamics is a philosophy and organics is a method. </p>
